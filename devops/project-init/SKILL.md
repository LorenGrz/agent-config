description: Use this skill when starting a new project or repo, or when adopting an existing one that this skill didn't generate. For new repos, scaffolds a repository that works with any AI agent (Codex, Cursor, Claude) and humans - a single AGENTS.md source of truth, CLAUDE.md as a thin pointer, .claude/ with the superpowers plugin and project hooks, a spec-driven workflow, branch flow feat|fix|refactor/<issue>-<slug> to dev with squash merge, a GitHub Project v2 per repo, and real enforcement via ESLint, a git pre-push hook, and CI. For existing repos, scripts/adopt.sh documents their current git workflow (branch/merge/CI reality, docs-only, no new hooks/CI/enforcement) and fills in the same AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/.agents/CONTEXT.md/docs/decisions documentation layer.

# Project Init

Scaffold a new repo once, correctly, instead of re-deciding workflow per project.

## Workflow

1. **Ask**: stack (`react-vite` | `next` | `nestjs` | `node-ts`), project name, visibility (default `public`). Remind the user: never commit secrets.

2. **Generate the app, if the target dir is empty**, with the stack's own official generator in its non-interactive form, then overlay this skill's templates. The dir/package name must be lowercase (npm rule) and may differ from the GitHub repo name (repo `Disfrazate`, dir/package `disfrazate`); `--name` below is the **GitHub repo name**:
   - react-vite: `pnpm create vite@latest <dir> --template react-ts --no-interactive --no-immediate`, then `pnpm -C <dir> install` (run from the parent dir; vite resolves `<dir>` relative to cwd)
   - next: `pnpm create next-app@latest <dir> --yes --use-pnpm --disable-git`
   - nestjs: `pnpm dlx @nestjs/cli new <dir> --directory <dir> --package-manager pnpm --skip-git --no-observe`
   - node-ts: just `mkdir <dir>`; `init.sh --install` creates `package.json` and `src/index.ts`
   Then run:
   ```
   bash scripts/init.sh --stack <stack> --name <repo-name> --dir <path> [--owner <owner>] [--project-number N] --install
   ```
   `--owner` defaults to `gh api user --jq .login` (if `gh` is authenticated), then `git config github.user`; pass it explicitly if neither resolves.
   Without `--install`, `init.sh` only prints the commands needed (devDependencies, missing package.json scripts); nothing is installed or written to `package.json` scripts.

3. **Local git setup** (do this, do not delegate it):
   - `git init -b main` if the directory is not already a repo.
   - Confirm `.gitignore` exists and covers: `node_modules/`, `.pnp*`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `.env` and `.env.*` (keep `!.env.example`), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*credentials*.json`, `*secret*.json`, `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.next/`, `.turbo/`, `coverage/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `*.log`, `.cache/`, `tmp/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/*` (keep `!.vscode/extensions.json`), `.superpowers/`. `init.sh` merges any missing baseline lines into the generator's `.gitignore`; only fix it if something is still missing.
   - `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
   - `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initial project setup"`
   - `bash scripts/verify-ci.sh --dir <path>` - clones the committed HEAD and runs CI's steps (install --frozen-lockfile, format:check, lint, typecheck, test, build). Fix anything red before step 4.

4. **External steps, one at a time, each confirmed by the user before running.** Never hand these to a background agent - they touch GitHub and real resources. `--owner` defaults the same way as `init.sh`'s (gh login, then `git config github.user`); pass it explicitly if neither resolves.
   ```
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh repo     [--owner <owner>] --name <name> --visibility public
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh dev      [--owner <owner>] --name <name>
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh settings [--owner <owner>] --name <name>
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh labels   [--owner <owner>] --name <name>
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh project  [--owner <owner>] --name <name>
   bash scripts/bootstrap-github.sh protect  [--owner <owner>] --name <name>
   ```
   `project` creates the Project, then replaces `TBD`/`{{PROJECT_NUMBER}}` in the repo (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/CONTEXT.md`), commits it (`chore: set project number to N`) and pushes the current branch itself - no manual commit.
   Run with `--dry-run` first any time you want to preview the exact `gh`/`git` commands without touching GitHub.

5. **Verify and report**: repo URL, dev as default branch, Project URL, CI green on the first PR.

## Daily workflow (what the generated AGENTS.md documents)

Everything starts as an issue in the Project. Non-trivial `feat`/`refactor` work goes through superpowers `brainstorming` -> a spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/` -> `writing-plans` -> a plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. `fix` work goes through `systematic-debugging` and only gets a spec if behavior changes. Then `scripts/gh-flow.sh start <type> <slug> --issue N`, implement with `subagent-driven-development` + `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, `scripts/gh-flow.sh pr`, wait for CI, `scripts/gh-flow.sh merge`. Base branch is always `dev`; `main` only moves via `scripts/gh-flow.sh release`. Agents without superpowers installed follow the same steps manually.

The generated `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for the new repo - read it there, not here, once a project exists. If the code and the doc disagree, fix the doc.

## Standards and enforcement

Every scaffolded repo carries Loren's engineering standards two ways: as conventions any AI reads (`AGENTS.md`'s "Engineering standards" section plus the stack's `AGENTS.stack.md`), and as mechanical enforcement wherever a tool can actually check it:

- **ESLint** (`eslint.config.*`, `typescript-eslint@8.71.1` as of writing): `no-explicit-any`, `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `consistent-type-imports`, `switch-exhaustiveness-check`, `no-unnecessary-condition` (all type-aware via `projectService: true`), plus `eqeqeq` and `no-console` (errors, allowing `console.warn`/`console.error`). react-vite/next also get `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@6.10.2` recommended rules and keep the existing zero-useEffect config (`eslint-plugin-react-hooks` + `eslint-plugin-react-you-might-not-need-an-effect`).
  - react-vite and nestjs: `pnpm create vite` and `nest new` both default to `oxlint` with no ESLint config at all now - this skill writes a flat `eslint.config.js`/`.mjs` that supersedes it (same pattern the zero-useEffect override already used for vite). `--install` points `lint` at `eslint` instead of the generator's `oxlint` default.
  - next: `eslint-config-next` already registers the `jsx-a11y` plugin itself (a handful of rules at `warn`). The template merges in `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`'s recommended **rules** object only, not its flat-config object (which would try to re-register the same plugin and crash with "Cannot redefine plugin"), and does not need `typescript-eslint` as a direct dependency - `eslint-config-next/typescript` already registers `@typescript-eslint`.
  - node-ts: has no generator, so the template ships the config outright, plus a pinned `typescript@^5` (typescript-eslint 8.x doesn't yet support TypeScript 7, which is now `npm`'s `latest` tag) and `@types/node`.
- **tsconfig strictness**: `init.sh --install` runs `scripts/ensure-tsconfig-strict.js` to turn on `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` in the project's tsconfig (`tsconfig.app.json` for react-vite, `tsconfig.json` for next/nestjs; node-ts's template ships all four already). All four flags were verified against the stock `pnpm create vite@latest --template react-ts`, `pnpm create next-app@latest`, and `pnpm dlx @nestjs/cli new` scaffolds (October 2026) - none needed to be skipped. The script uses the project's own installed `typescript` to parse the file (comments and all) before deciding what's missing, and only inserts the missing flags as text so existing comments/formatting survive; without `--install` it only prints what it would do.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the `ci` job (kept as-is, branch protection depends on that check name) gains a non-blocking `pnpm audit --audit-level high` step (`continue-on-error: true`) and a `docs-check` step (see below). A new `secret-scan` job runs `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v3` with `fetch-depth: 0` - free for personal GitHub accounts, no `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` needed. (The task that commissioned this used `@v2`; v2 is EOL as of September 2026 per the project's own README, so this scaffolds `@v3` instead - same inputs/behavior, different Node runtime underneath.)

## Documentation layer

Every scaffolded repo carries enough documentation for a new agent session to work from docs alone: `AGENTS.md`'s "Documentation map" points, in order, to `.agents/CONTEXT.md` (current stack/architecture snapshot), `docs/plans/HANDOFF.md` (current state + how to resume mid-flight work), `docs/architecture.md` (overview/modules/data model/flows/env/deploy skeleton), `docs/decisions/` (ADRs for trade-offs, starting at `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`, new ones copied from `0000-template.md`), and `docs/superpowers/specs|plans/` (the existing spec-driven workflow). `AGENTS.md`'s "Documentation rules" section says when each gets written and keeps `AGENTS.md` itself capped at ~150 lines. The PR template checklist and a non-blocking `docs-check` step in CI (`scripts/docs-check.sh`, warns via `::warning::` when a PR touches deps/env/docker/workflows/top-level folders without touching docs) nudge toward keeping it current; neither blocks a merge.

## Adopting an existing repo

Use `scripts/adopt.sh` instead of `init.sh` when the repo was **not** generated by this skill and already has its own history, CI, and flow. Adopt is docs-only: it never adds hooks, CI, ESLint, pre-push, or branch protection - any of those would break whatever the repo already does. It documents the repo's CURRENT reality (a "Workflow contract" table that may legitimately say "nothing (convention only)" in every row) and only RECOMMENDS stronger enforcement in its output, capped at 3 bullets.

1. Create a worktree from the repo's default branch - never touch the user's own working tree/branch, which may be dirty or mid-task:
   ```
   git -C <repo> fetch origin
   git -C <repo> worktree add ../<repo>-adopt -b docs/workflow-contract origin/<default>
   ```
   (`<default>` is whatever `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` reports, `main`/`master` otherwise.)
2. Run `bash scripts/adopt.sh --dir ../<repo>-adopt` (add `--dry-run` to preview, `--json` for machine-readable output). It detects the default/dev branch, branch protection, merge settings, branch naming and commit-message history, CI, hooks, PR/issue templates, and package manager/scripts, then fills in or creates `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/decisions/{0000,0001}-*.md`, and `docs/plans/HANDOFF.md` - never overwriting a file that already carries real content. Idempotent: a second run makes no changes.
3. Review the diff in the worktree, especially the generated "Workflow contract" table - fix anything detection got wrong before committing.
4. Commit there: `git -C ../<repo>-adopt add AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md .agents docs && git -C ../<repo>-adopt commit -m "docs: add workflow contract and agent docs"`.
5. Push and land the change following the **repo's own** workflow, not this skill's: open a PR if the repo already uses PRs or has branch protection, otherwise `git merge --no-ff` straight into the default branch.
6. Remove the worktree: `git -C <repo> worktree remove ../<repo>-adopt` (and delete the branch if it wasn't merged with `--no-ff` locally first).

## Notes

- `init.sh` never overwrites an existing file unless `--force`; it prints `skip <path> (exists)` instead. Safe to re-run (verified by diffing the tree before/after a second run with no flags changed). Two files are a deliberate exception: `eslint.config.js`/`.mjs` and `AGENTS.md` still get overlaid even if a file already exists there, as long as that file doesn't carry this skill's own marker text yet - `create-next-app --eslint` writes its own `eslint.config.mjs`, and Next 16+ also writes a short `AGENTS.md` (regenerated by `next dev` regardless, per its own comment), both at the exact paths this skill needs to own. Once this skill's version is in place (marker present), normal skip-if-exists behavior resumes.
- `nest new`'s current scaffold ships Vitest, not Jest (`init.sh`'s default `test` script for nestjs follows suit: `vitest run --passWithNoTests`, only used when the generator's own `package.json` is missing a `test` script, which it currently never is).
- CI's lint step is `pnpm run --if-present lint --max-warnings 0`, with no `--` separator before the flag: the installed pnpm (12.5.1 as of writing) forwards every token after the script name verbatim, including a literal `--`, which breaks `eslint`'s arg parsing if one is added back.
- `bootstrap-github.sh all` only runs with `--dry-run` (refuses otherwise) - the real sequence is always confirmed step by step per item 4.
- `.gitignore` is the other exception to skip-if-exists: generators write their own, so `init.sh` appends every template line not already present under a `# project-init baseline` header (`merged .gitignore (+N lines)`, or `skip .gitignore (complete)` on re-run).
- `init.sh --install` adds any tool the scripts call but the project doesn't declare (`prettier`, `vitest`, `tsx`) to the same `pnpm add -D` as the ESLint deps, writes `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds.esbuild: false` when `tsx` comes in (pnpm otherwise aborts with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`), and ends with `pnpm run format` so CI's `format:check` passes. `.prettierignore` skips `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- `test` is `vitest run --passWithNoTests` on every stack (bare `vitest` is watch mode and exits 1 with no test files; an existing bare `vitest` is replaced). next's `typecheck` is `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` (global types like `LayoutProps` live in gitignored `.next/types`; an existing bare `tsc --noEmit` is replaced).
- `bootstrap-github.sh` and `gh-flow.sh` export `CLICOLOR_FORCE=0 NO_COLOR=1`: a shell with `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1`/`FORCE_COLOR=1` makes `gh --format json | jq` fail on ANSI codes, and only `CLICOLOR_FORCE=0` turns it off. `gh-flow.sh start` uses `git pull --autostash` so a dirty tree survives pull.rebase.
- The project's `guard-branch.sh` hook blocks `git commit`/`git push` on dev/main, except the initial commit (no HEAD yet). It judges the repo the command targets (`git -C <dir>` or a leading `cd <dir> &&`), not the session cwd.
- node-ts's ESLint config is `eslint.config.mjs` so it loads regardless of the package `"type"`.
- After editing anything in this skill, run `bash scripts/e2e.sh --stack all` (generates all four stacks in temp dirs, runs `init.sh --install`, `verify-ci.sh`, and an idempotency re-run; never touches GitHub). It must end with every stack PASS.
