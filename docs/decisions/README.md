# Decisions (ADRs)

- [0001 — One repo for agent config and skills](0001-single-repo.md) — fold `aws-skills` into `aws/` via `git subtree`; drop external symlinks.
- [0002 — rulesync for multi-AI rule/skill distribution](0002-rulesync-for-multi-ai.md) — `config/rulesync/build.sh` rebuilds a throwaway `.rulesync/` tree from the real sources.
- [0003 — Model routing by task complexity, not by habit](0003-model-routing-by-complexity.md) — Opus decides, Sonnet writes, Haiku looks up; escalate to `reasoner` after two failures.
- [0004 — Token budget for always-loaded files](0004-token-budget.md) — keep `config/CLAUDE.md` ≤60 lines; move detail to the thing it describes.
- [0005 — Portable install, personal profiles, and a plugin marketplace](0005-portable-install-and-profiles.md) — personal content in `config/profiles/<name>.md`; `install.sh --profile`; marketplace subset.
- [0006 — The main session delegates open lookups and large changes](0006-always-delegate.md) — open lookups to `scout`, large changes to `worker`; small known-file edits stay inline.
- [0007 — Rename agent-config to agents-config](0007-rename-to-agents-config.md) — repo, plugin, marketplace, docs and setup skill renamed.
- [0008 — SessionStart hook for routing and codebase-map refresh](0008-session-start-hook.md) — re-inject routing each session; nudge to refresh `.agents/CONTEXT.md` in large or stale repos.
