description: Example personal workflow-adapter skill (Loren's own setup, kept as a reference pattern). Reuses an existing Codex/local agent setup from Claude Code. Use when work involves existing Codex skills, migration from Codex to Claude, or other skill roots listed in your profile.

# Codex Workflows Adapter

Adapts Claude Code to an existing Codex setup without duplicating stale instructions. This
skill is Loren's own example, not a generic tool — if you're adapting it for your own
setup, copy it, point it at your own skill roots, and list them in your profile
(`config/profiles/<your-name>.md`) instead of hardcoding them here.

## First Step

Identify the task category, then read only the relevant source skill files before acting.

Skill roots: this hub (`~/.agents/skills`, i.e. wherever this repo is cloned) plus any
extra roots listed under "Codex workflow adapter" in your profile
(`config/profiles/<your-name>.md`) — e.g. `~/.codex/skills` or an OS-specific skill path.

## Routing

- New JS/TS project or standard scripts: `typescript-project-starter` skill in this hub.
- Roadmap planning or learning project scope: `roadmap-coach` skill in this hub.
- React frontend implementation/refactor: `react-scalable-frontend` skill in this hub.
- React component lifecycle review: `react-component-validator` skill in this hub.
- TypeScript quality: `typescript-code-quality` skill in this hub.
- API contracts: `api-contract-design` skill in this hub.
- Auth/security implementation: `auth-security-basics` skill in this hub.
- Security review by explicit request: check your profile's extra skill roots.
- NestJS module generation: `nest-module-generator` skill in this hub.
- Persistence/database work: `database-persistence-patterns` skill in this hub.
- Docker-backed local environment: `run-docker-environment` skill in this hub.
- Test-suite execution and fix loop: `execute-test-suite` skill in this hub.
- Repository context maintenance: `repository-context-maintainer` skill in this hub.
- Desktop/OS config, PDFs, browser automation: check your profile's extra skill roots.

## Rules

- Load skills progressively. Do not paste every skill into context.
- Prefer local project scripts and local dependencies.
- Preserve user changes. Do not revert unrelated files.
- For desktop/OS config, test first and ask before pushing to the settings repo named in
  your profile.
- For roadmap work, keep the next step small and aligned with the sequence in your profile
  or the `roadmap-coach` skill.

## Startup Check For A Personal Roadmap Repo

If your profile names a roadmap repo, read, when relevant:

- `<roadmap-repo>/README.md`
- `<roadmap-repo>/.agents/CONTEXT.md`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` if package installation or workspace behavior is involved.

Remember: `node_modules/` must stay untracked.
