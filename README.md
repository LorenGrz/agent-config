# agents-config

Lorenzo Graizzaro's **agent config + skills hub**, built to be portable: one repo that
configures every coding AI anyone uses (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Google
Antigravity/Gemini) the same way, plus the on-demand skill library they all share. Clone it
and point your own agent at it — personal content (names, paths, learning stage, GitHub
owner) lives only in `config/profiles/<your-name>.md`, never in the shared files.

Two things live here, and they're both "always available, loaded only when needed":

- **Config** (`config/`) — instructions, path-scoped rules, lifecycle hooks, and the three
  model-pinned subagents. Generated/symlinked into `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` by
  `install.sh`.
- **Skills** (category directories below) — `SKILL.md` files loaded on demand when their
  `description` matches the task, mirrored flat into `~/.claude/skills` by `sync.sh`.

Neither of these makes a project well-run on its own — see ["How it works"](#how-it-works)
for the second, per-project layer (`project-init`) that does the actual enforcement.

## Install

Pick **one** method per machine — they overlap and aren't meant to be combined.

### Method 1 — `install.sh` (full: config + rules + hooks + subagents + skills)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LorenGrz/agents-config ~/.agents/skills
~/.agents/skills/install.sh --dry-run    # preview, changes nothing
~/.agents/skills/install.sh --profile <your-name>
```

Inside a Claude Code or Codex session opened in the clone, you can instead just ask your
agent to "install this repo" — see `AGENTS.md` and the `agents-config-setup` skill, which
implement the same guided flow (dry-run → resolve/create your profile → confirm → install →
verify).

`--profile` picks `config/profiles/<name>.md` to import into your generated
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. No existing profile and no `--profile`? It
tries `gh api user --jq .login`; if that doesn't match an existing profile either, it copies
`config/profiles/_template.md` for you to fill in, or falls back to using the template
directly if `gh` isn't available. Fill in your own profile — see
`config/profiles/_template.md` — rather than editing `config/AGENTS.md`/`config/CLAUDE.md`,
which stay generic for everyone who clones this repo.

Re-run `install.sh` any time — it is idempotent and never deletes a real file (see
[Install / update workflow](#install--update-workflow)).

### Method 2 — Claude Code plugin marketplace (skills + agents + hooks only)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add LorenGrz/agents-config
claude plugin install agents-config@agents-config
```

Gets you the skill library, the three subagents, and the generic lifecycle hooks (not
`guard-omarchy` or the cost-tracking status line — those stay `install.sh`-only). It does
**not** get you path-scoped rules (rules aren't a Claude Code plugin component at all) or
the generated `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`settings.json` merge — use Method 1 for those.

Profiles: everything personal (identity, preferred language, GitHub owner, learning stage,
your own project/tool paths) lives in `config/profiles/<your-name>.md`, never in
`config/AGENTS.md`/`config/CLAUDE.md` — those two are imported by `install.sh` into every
agent session and must stay shareable with anyone who clones this repo. Copy
`config/profiles/_template.md` to get started, or let `install.sh`/the
`agents-config-setup` skill offer to do it for you.

the directories above for the full list with links, or run `rg description */*/SKILL.md`.

## How it works

Two independent layers. Neither needs the other, but most real repos want both.

### Global — always active, in any folder, zero setup

What's active depends on when it loads, not whether it's "installed":

| Loads | When | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` | Every session, in full, before the first message | `config/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code), `config/AGENTS.md` (Codex, others) |
| Skills | Description only, until the task matches and the model invokes it | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, flat mirror of `<category>/<skill>/` |
| Rules | Only when a touched file matches `paths:` frontmatter | `config/rules/*.md` |
| Hooks | Executed by the harness at a lifecycle event — **not** read by the model | `config/hooks/*.sh`, wired in `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Subagents (`scout`/`worker`/`reasoner`) | Dispatched explicitly, each with its own model pin | `config/agents/*.md` |
| Auto-memory | Loaded by the harness at session start, outside this repo | `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` |

Hooks, concretely (event → script):

| Event | Script | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) | `guard-omarchy.sh` | denies edits under `~/.local/share/omarchy/` |
| `PreToolUse` (Bash) | `scout-readonly.sh` | inside the `scout` subagent only: allows read-only commands, denies writes |
| `PostToolUse` (Edit/Write/MultiEdit) | `format-file.sh` | runs the project's own formatter/linter on the edited file |
| `Stop` | `stop-git-status.sh` | shows uncommitted changes when in a git repo |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | `log-instructions.sh` | logs what got loaded to `~/.claude/logs/instructions-loaded.log` |

The plugin marketplace method (below) ships the last four as a generic subset
(`hooks/hooks.json`) and omits `guard-omarchy.sh` (desktop-specific) and the cost-tracking
status line (untracked, machine-local).

Generated files + symlink map (`install.sh` creates/repairs these; see `config/README.md`
for the full list — `<repo>` is wherever you cloned this):

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  (generated — @-imports <repo>/config/{AGENTS.md,profiles/<name>.md,CLAUDE.md})
~/.codex/AGENTS.md   (generated — <repo>/config/AGENTS.md + your profile, concatenated)
~/.claude/rules ───────┐
~/.claude/hooks ───────┼──► <repo>/config/{rules,hooks,agents}
~/.claude/agents ──────┘
~/.claude/skills/<name> ──► <repo>/<category>/<name>/   (flat mirror, via sync.sh)
```

### Per-project — `project-init`, once per real repo

The global layer only *guides* a model. It can't stop a human, a different AI, or a model
having a bad day from skipping it — instructions are advisory, not enforced. `project-init`
(`devops/project-init/`) scaffolds a repo so the standards hold regardless of who or what is
driving:

| Adds | Why |
|---|---|
| Project `AGENTS.md` (+ thin `CLAUDE.md` pointer) | one source of truth any AI reads, not a Claude-only doc |
| `.claude/settings.json` with superpowers + branch/lint hooks | this project's Claude Code picks up spec-driven workflow + guardrails automatically |
| ESLint (type-aware: `no-explicit-any`, `no-floating-promises`, ...) + strict `tsconfig` | a human or any AI can turn these off in a prompt; they can't turn off a lint/build failure |
| Git pre-push hook + CI (`ci`, `secret-scan` via gitleaks) | enforcement that runs even if nobody reads `AGENTS.md` at all |
| `scripts/gh-flow.sh` | `start`/`pr`/`merge`/`release` — same branch flow every repo, no re-deciding |
| GitHub Project v2 (backlog, labels, protected branch) | work is tracked as issues, not lost in chat history |
| `docs/` layer: `.agents/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/decisions/` (ADRs), `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/`, `docs/plans/HANDOFF.md` | a new session reads docs instead of re-deriving the codebase; see the global docs rule in `AGENTS.md`'s Working Style |

In short: instructions (global layer) only guide Claude; repo enforcement (`project-init`)
works for any AI *and* humans, because it lives in the tooling, not the prompt.

### When do I need `project-init`?

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| One-off script, scratch exploration, a file you're reading not shipping | Nothing — global layer is enough |
| A real repo that will get a second commit, a PR, or outlive this session | Run `project-init` |
| An existing repo without it | Run `project-init`'s scaffolding selectively, or at minimum add `AGENTS.md` + the `docs/` layer by hand |

## Model routing by complexity

See ADR [0003](docs/decisions/0003-model-routing-by-complexity.md) for the reasoning; the
rule itself (also in `config/CLAUDE.md`, which loads every session):

| Model / subagent | Does | Never does |
|---|---|---|
| Opus / `reasoner` (main session) | Decides: architecture, unknown-cause bugs, plan review, hard-to-reverse calls | Worker-type writing |
| Sonnet / `worker` | Writes all code/docs from an already-decided plan | Open-ended decisions |
| Haiku / `scout` | Light read-only lookups | Writes, decisions |

Open lookups (unknown paths, web, docs) go to `scout`; large changes (more than 3 files or
bulk writing) go to `worker`; small changes to ≤3 known files stay inline. Opus decides,
writes specs, reviews, and reports. See [ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-always-delegate.md).

## Multi-AI: Codex, Cursor, Antigravity (Gemini)

| Gets | Via | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` generated file (install.sh) *or* rulesync (redundant for this file — see ADR 0002) | full `AGENTS.md` + your profile |
| Cursor | rulesync global skills/subagents/mcp/hooks/permissions; **not** global rules (unsupported upstream) | `config/rulesync/` proof skills only |
| Google Antigravity (Gemini-family CLI/IDE) | rulesync global rules + skills (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.gemini/config/rules/*.md`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`) | full `AGENTS.md` + `config/rules/*.md` + proof skills |
| Claude Code | native: `config/CLAUDE.md`, skills mirror, rules, hooks, subagents | everything |

Generate/update the Cursor + Antigravity copies:

```bash
./install.sh --with-rulesync
```

See `config/rulesync/` and ADR [0002](docs/decisions/0002-rulesync-for-multi-ai.md) for how
the source tree is built (from `config/AGENTS.md` + `config/rules/*.md` + three proof
skills, not duplicated by hand) and exactly which tool/feature combinations rulesync
actually supports in global mode — it is not symmetric across tools.

## Token efficiency

- `config/CLAUDE.md` loads every session — kept ≤60 lines (ADR
  [0004](docs/decisions/0004-token-budget.md)). Detail that's rarely needed moved into the
  skill it's about (e.g. the roadmap detail lives in `roadmap-coach`'s `references/`, not in
  always-loaded `AGENTS.md`).
- Measure actual spend with [`ccusage`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage):
  `npx ccusage@latest` (install.sh prints this hint).
- [`rtk`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) (optional, `install.sh --with-rtk`) is a separate
  token-reduction tool for repeated agent runs — install it deliberately, not by default.
- Per-project MCP servers and the Vercel plugin are opt-in per repo
  (`.claude/settings.local.json`), not globally enabled — `config/settings.base.json` ships
  `vercel@claude-plugins-official: false` and only `superpowers` on by default.
- Prefer `/clear` between unrelated tasks over `/compact` — a fresh session is cheaper than
  summarizing a long one just to keep going.

## Install / update workflow

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run                      # print planned actions only
./install.sh --profile <name>                # generate CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, symlinks, settings.json
./install.sh --profile <name> --with-rulesync # also generate Cursor/Antigravity config
./install.sh --profile <name> --with-rtk      # also install rtk + `rtk init -g`
```

Adding or changing a skill:

```bash
# 1. create/edit <repo>/<category>/<skill>/SKILL.md
# 2. ./sync.sh                              # refresh ~/.claude/skills
# 3. git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push
# 4. keep any personal mirror clone you maintain in sync (your profile, not this file)
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| A skill doesn't activate | `/context` to see what's loaded; confirm `SKILL.md`'s `description` actually matches the task |
| Rules/hooks seem stale | `./sync.sh` then `/doctor`; confirm the symlink still resolves (`readlink ~/.claude/rules`) |
| Hook not firing | `/hooks` to see registered hooks; `~/.claude/logs/instructions-loaded.log` shows what loaded and when |
| `settings.json` looks wrong after install | check the timestamped `.bak.<timestamp>` next to it — `install.sh` always backs up before writing |
